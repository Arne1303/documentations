# View Interceptor

## Introduction

While Converge has a highly customizable UI through themes, it also allows you to inject views at specific points during the rendering process. The view interceptor gives you this flexibility you can register views or hooks at predefined view locations. This is especially useful when adding UI elements like cards (e.g., Carbon Ads) or badges to specific items in the sidebar.
